The purpose of this work was to perform an independent and NIST-traceable activity measurement of 90Y SIR-Spheres®. \n\nMethods: Gamma spectroscopic measurements of the 90Y internal pair production decay mode were made using a high-purity germanium detector. Un-modified patient SIR-Spheres® vials were placed within a high-density polyethylene source holder positioned at a distance of 210 cm from the detector, with acquisition durations of 3 – 6 hours. Measured annihilation radiation detection rates were corrected for radioactive decay during acquisition, dead time, source attenuation, and source geometry effects. Detection efficiency was determined by two independent and NIST-traceable methods. Resulting 90Y activity measurements were compared against the manufacturer activity calibration. \n\nResults: Measured SIR-Sphere® vials (n = 5) were found to contain more activity than specified by the manufacturer calibration – on average the ratio of measured activity to calibrated was 1.233 ± 0.030. Activity measurements made using two distinct efficiency calibration methods were found to agree within 1%. Uncertainty in individual measurements was dominated by counting statistical uncertainty (~2.5%), uncertainty in the internal pair production branching ratio of 90Y (1.5%), and efficiency calibration (1.2% – 1.9%). \n\nConclusion: The primary SIR-Spheres® activity calibration appears to be a significant underestimate of true activity. This mis-calibration has likely been consistent for as long as the SIR-Sphere® product has been available. This finding should be independently verified, and steps should be taken by the manufacturer to establish an accurate and traceable activity standard.

Investigation into the imaging properties of a hypothetical extended axial field-of-view (AFOV) GE Healthcare SiPM-based Discovery MI (DMI) system architecture has not yet been performed. In this work, we assessed its potential as a whole-body scanner using Monte Carlo simulations. The aim of this work was to (1) develop and validate a Monte Carlo model of a four-ring scanner and (2) extend its AFOV up to 2 m to evaluate performance gain through NEMA-based evaluation. \n\nMethods: \n The DMI four-ring geometry and its pulse digitization scheme were modeled within the GATE Monte Carlo platform using published literature. The GATE scanner model was validated by comparing results against published NEMA performance measurements. Following the validation of the four-ring model, the model was extended to simulate 8-, 20-, 30-, and 40-ring systems. Spatial resolution, sensitivity, NECR, and scatter fraction were characterized with modified NEMA NU-2 2018 standards; however, the image quality measurements were not acquired due to computational limitations. Spatial resolutions were simulated for all scanner ring configurations using point sources to examine the effects of parallax errors. NEMA count rates were estimated using a standard 70 cm scatter phantom and an extended version of scatter phantom of length 200 cm with (1-800) MBq of 18F for all scanners. Sensitivity was evaluated using NEMA methods with a 70 cm standard and a 200 cm long line source. \n\nResults: \n The average FWHM of the radial/tangential/axial spatial resolution reconstructed with filtered back-projection at 1 and 10 cm from the scanner center were 3.94/4.10/4.41 mm and 5.29/4.89/5.90 mm for the four-ring scanner. Sensitivity was determined to be 14.86 cps/kBq at the center of the FOV for the four-ring scanner using a 70 cm line source. Sensitivity enhancement up to 21-fold and 60-fold were observed for 1 and 2 m AFOV scanners compared to four-ring scanner using a 200 cm long line source. Spatial resolution simulations in a 2 m AFOV scanner suggest a maximum degradation of ∼23.8% in the axial resolution compared to the four-ring scanner. However, the transverse resolution was found to be relatively constant when increasing the axial acceptance angle up to ±70°. The peak NECR was 212.92 kcps at 22.70 kBq/ml with a scatter fraction of 38.9% for a four-ring scanner with a 70 cm scatter phantom. Comparison of peak NECR using the 200 cm long scatter phantom relative to the four-ring scanner resulted in a NECR gain of 15 for the 20-ring and 28 for the 40-ring geometry. Spatial resolution, sensitivity, and scatter fraction showed an agreement within ∼7% compared with published measured values. \n\nConclusions: \n The four-ring DMI scanner simulation was successfully validated against published NEMA measurements. Sensitivity and NECR performance of extended 1 and 2 m AFOV scanners based upon the DMI architecture were subsequently simulated. Increases in sensitivity and count-rate performance are consistent with prior simulation studies utilizing extensions of the Siemens mCT architecture and published NEMA measurements with the uEXPLORER system.

Two platforms have so-far been developed, the uEXPLORER and PennPET EXPLORER. The uEXPLORER is based on the United Imaging Healthcare's uMI 550 and 780 SiPM PET/CT scanners, while the PennPET Explorer is based on the Philips SiPM technology used in the Vereos scanner. To our knowledge, investigation into the imaging properties of a hypothetical long AFOV GE Healthcare SiPM scanner based upon the Discovery MI system architecture has not been studied. The current GE Discovery MI scanner is available in 3, 4, and 5-rings (15, 20, and 25 cm AFOV). The aim of this work was (1) to develop and validate a Monte Carlo model of a 4-ring DMI scanner and (2) to extend its AFOV up to 2 m to evaluate its performance gain using standard NEMA measures. \n\nMethods: The GE Discovery MI geometry and pulse digitization scheme were modeled within the GATE (Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission) platform using published literature. Validation of the 4-ring GATE scanner model was performed by comparing published NEMA performance measurements [1] against the Monte Carlo simulations' results. The simulated scanner deadtime was heuristically tuned to match the experimental measurements. Following validation of the 4-ring model, the model was extended to simulate 20 ring (1 meter) and 40 ring (2 meter) systems.  Spatial resolution, scanner sensitivity, Noise Equivalent Count Rate (NECR), and scatter fraction were characterized with slightly modified NEMA NU-2 2018 standards as described in [2]. NEMA count rates were estimated with an extended 175 cm long 20 cm diameter cylindrical scatter phantom with a 4 MBq 18F source for 4, 20, and 40-ring scanners. Relative gains in NECR were obtained by comparing peak NECR values. Additionally, the sensitivities were evaluated using NEMA methods, although with an extended 170 cm long line source. \n\nResults: The average FWHM of the radial/tangential/axial spatial resolution reconstructed with filtered back-projection at 1 and 10 cm from the scanner center were 3.84/3.99/4.41 mm and 5.17/4.96/4.90 mm for the 4-ring scanner. NEMA sensitivity was measured as 15.39 cps/kBq at the center of the scanner FOV for the 4-ring scanner, and the scatter fraction at the NECR peak was 38.23%. Spatial resolution, sensitivity, and scatter fraction showed an agreement within 7.10%, 9.50%, and 4.15%, respectively, compared to published measured values [1]. The comparison of peak NECR with the standard 70 cm long NEMA scatter phantom in 4-ring scanner with 175 cm phantom in 40-ring scanner demonstrated a ~25× increase in NECR. The scanner with AFOV of 1 m resulted in a sensitivity gain of 8.5 times and for 2 m resulted in sensitivity gains of ~24-fold relative to the current Discovery MI 4-ring scanner. \n\nConclusions: Simulation of the 4-ring GE Discovery MI scanner was successfully validated, within measurement errors, against published NEMA performance data for all NEMA tests. Sensitivity and NECR performance of extended 1 and 2 meters AFOV scanners based upon the DMI architecture was subsequently simulated. Increases in sensitivity and count-rate performance are consistent with prior simulation studies utilizing extensions of the Siemens mCT architecture [3], and published NEMA measurements with the uEXPLORER system. The results of this work suggest a factor of substantial sensitivity enhancement when imaging patients on hypothetical 1 and 2 m long DMI scanner compared to a 4-ring 20 cm long DMI scanner. These performance enhancements are in-line with those measured on the uEXPLORER and PennPET EXPLORER platforms.","tags":[],"title":"Monte Carlo simulation of 4-ring Discovery MI PET/CT scanner and its extended axial field-of-view to 2 m","type":"event"},{"authors":["Ashok Tiwari, Ph.D."],"categories":[""],"content":"Overview This post will share our python developments to analyze the SNMMI’s Phantom Analysis Toolkit (PAT) analysis.json output file.\nThe SNMMI is providing a cloud-based automated Phantom Analysis Toolkit (PAT).

One emerging beta-emitting radioisotope of interest for therapy is 67Cu (t1/2 2.6 d) due to its chemical equivalency with the widely-established positron-emitting isotope 64Cu (t1/2 12.7 h). In this work we evaluate both the imaging and dosimetric characteristics of 67Cu, as well as producing the first report of SPECT/CT imaging using 67Cu. To this end, 67Cu was produced by photon-induced reactions on isotopically-enriched 68Zn at the Low-Energy Accelerator Facility (LEAF) of Argonne National Laboratory, followed by bulk separation of metallic 68Zn by sublimation and radiochemical purification by column chromatography. Gamma spectrometry was performed by efficiency-calibrated high-purity germanium (HPGe) analysis to verify absolute activity calibration and establish radionuclidic purity. Absolute activity measurements corroborated manufacturer-recommended dose-calibrator settings and no radionuclidic impurities were observed. Using the Clinical Trials Network anthropomorphic chest phantom, SPECT/CT images were acquired. Medium energy (ME) SPECT collimation was found to provide the best image quality from the primary 185 keV gamma emission of 67Cu. Reconstructed images of 67Cu were similar in quality to images acquired using 177Lu. Recovery coefficients were calculated and compared against quantitative images of 99mTc, 177Lu, and 64Cu within the same anthropomorphic chest phantom. Production and clinical imaging of 67Cu appears feasible, and future studies investigating the therapeutic efficacy of 67Cu-based radiopharmaceuticals are warranted.","tags":[],"title":"Imaging and dosimetric characteristics of 67 Cu","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashok Tiwari and John Sunderland"],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the presentation slides.

Radiochromic film (Gafchromic EBT3) was laser cut to accommodate orthogonal line sources of radioactivity, and the film was sandwiched intimately between the rectangular blocks to achieve charged particle equilibrium. Line sources consisted of plastic capillary tube of length (13 ± 0.1) cm, with 0.42‐mm inner diameter and a wall thickness of 0.21 mm. 90Y line sources were prepared from a solution of dissolved 90Y resin microspheres. 177Lu line sources were prepared from an aliquot of 177Lu‐DOTATATE.

The fundamental weakness of this approach is that, to date, Monte Carlo-based dose calculations have never been empirically validated in a controlled laboratory setting due to the fundamental difficulty of measuring spatial dose deposition for therapeutic beta emitters (i.e. 90Y and 177Lu) with a very high spatial resolution. The goal of this work was to develop and test an experimental methodology for high-resolution beta dosimetry and to compare results from this method with Monte Carlo simulations performed in the same geometry. \n\nMethods: 90Y and 177Lu line sources (plastic capillary tube of length 13 cm, 0.8 mm outer diameter, 0.4 mm inner diameter) were inserted longitudinally through blocks of low-density polyethylene and cortical bone and lung tissue-equivalent plastic (CIRS, Norfolk, VA). Radiochromic film EBT3 was laser-cut to provide a 0.8 mm diameter hole to accommodate orthogonal line-sources of radioactivity with the same outer diameter. The film was sandwiched tightly between the rectangular slabs with identical 0.8mm holes to achieve scatter equilibrium in the plane of the film. Final activity densities in the line sources were (0.34 ± 0.015) MBq/cm and (0.35 ± 0.014) MBq/cm for 90Y and 177Lu, respectively. Film exposures were conducted for durations ranging from 10 minutes to 38 hours to achieve exposures within the linear range of the EBT3 film (0.1-10 Gy). All experimental geometries were precisely simulated within the GATE Monte Carlo toolkit, which has previously been used to produce dose point kernels for 90Y and 177Lu. Radiochromic film calibration was achieved by irradiation with 6 MV bremsstrahlung x-rays from a calibrated linear accelerator (Siemens Oncor), in accordance with literature recommendations[1]. \n\nResults: Experimentally measured doses agreed closely with Monte Carlo calculations. For 90Y and 177Lu absorbed doses, the mean local percentage difference in the dose distribution compared to Monte Carlo simulation was ~6.0%. Discrepancies were highest close to the line source, due to the delamination of the film during the laser-cutting process. 1D gamma analysis [2] was performed using the 10%/1 mm gamma criterion to compare the simulated and measured dose distributions. The percentage of measurement points meeting the gamma criterion, averaged over all tests, was 93.5%. \n\nConclusions: We report the first high-resolution experimental validation of Monte Carlo-simulated dose deposition from beta particles. Excellent agreement was observed between the experimental beta absorbed doses compared with GATE Monte Carlo simulations for 90Y and 177Lu, suggesting that dosimetry based on beta dose kernels derived from GATE Monte Carlo simulations are sufficiently accurate for clinical use. Future work should expand these methods to other therapeutic radionuclides and measurement geometries.","tags":[],"title":"Experimental validation of Monte Carlo-generated beta absorbed doses for 3D voxelwise dosimetry","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project aimed to experimentally validate the GATE Monte Carlo genarated beta absorbed dose distributions.

We demonstrate that the (α,γ) cross sections obtained from talys include the energy-broadened cross sections for discrete states in the high-energy tail of the spectra, which are required in order to compare with the angle-integrated and double-differential spectra obtained from a liquid scintillator detector with an energy resolution of only ≈15%. A comparison with varying “elwidth” shows that cross sections indeed are reliable within the energy region (4 to 10 MeV) reported by TZMC, especially for the dominant contribution, which is the aluminum wall of the detector. Any differences in the (α,γ) cross sections for 16O at the level detailed by Mohr will have negligible effect on the final flux.","tags":[],"title":"Reply to “Comment on ‘Observation of annual modulation induced by γ rays from (α,γ) reactions at the Soudan Underground Laboratory' ”","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashok Tiwari","Stephen Graves","and John Sunderland"],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the presentation slides.
